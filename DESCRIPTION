Description: R Commander plug-in for repeated-measures and mixed-design
    ('split-plot') ANOVA.
    It adds a new menu entry for repeated measures that allows
    to deal with up to three within-subject factors and optionally with
    one or several between-subject factors.
    It also provides supplementary options to oneWayAnova() and
    multiWayAnova() functions, such as choice of ANOVA type, display of
    effect sizes and post hoc analysis for multiWayAnova().

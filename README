R Commander plug-in for repeated-measures and mixed-design ('split-plot') ANOVA.
It adds a new menu entry for repeated measures that allows to deal with up to 
three within-subject factors and optionally with one or several between-subject 
factors.
It also provides supplementary options to oneWayAnova() and multiWayAnova() 
functions, such as choice of ANOVA type, display of effect sizes and post hoc 
analysis for multiWayAnova().
